# Spree Payment Type Promotion

This spree extension allows you to create promotion based on what payment type is selected at checkout.

Currently I don't have it set up to add payment types from the admin view.

A good way to set this up right now would be code like this:

```ruby
promotion = Spree::Promotion.find_or_initialize_by(name: 'Pay with credit card and receive 15% off your order')
payment_type = promotion.promotion_rules.find_or_initialize_by(type: 'Spree::Promotion::Rules::PaymentType')
payment_type.payment_methods << [Spree::PaymentMethod.find_by_name('Credit Card')]
```

## Installation

Add spree_payment_type_promotion to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'spree_payment_type_promotion', github: 'QuintinAdam/spree_payment_type_promotion', branch: '3-0-stable'
```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rails g spree_payment_type_promotion:install
```

### Testing

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use it's factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'spree_payment_type_promotion/factories'
```
